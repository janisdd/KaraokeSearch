A little helper for UltraStar karaoke sessions.


## Install

```bash
yarn install
```

you have to copy the `.env_example` to `.env` and set all values

- `ULTRA_START_SONGS_DIR_PATH` is the path to the ultrastar songs dir (no nesting)
- `PLAYLIST_CACHE_DIR_PATH` the path for caching playlists (only required when using spotify features)
	- gets automatically created (recursively)
- `IS_DEFAULT_PAGE_THEME_MODE_DARK` `true` or `false`, the page has a dark mode, if `true`, the dark mode is initially used (on first load)


you have to copy the `secrets/.env_example` to `secrets/.env` and set all values

for the spotify stuff you need a account and a spotify app, see https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started
