![logo](public/logo.png)

A little helper for UltraStar karaoke sessions.

## Requirements

- nodejs (20.x or later)
- yarn


## Install

```bash
yarn install
```

you have to copy the `.env_example` to `.env` and set all values

- `ULTRA_START_SONGS_DIR_PATH1` is the path to the ultrastar songs dir (no nesting)
	- you can use `ULTRA_START_SONGS_DIR_PATH2`, `ULTRA_START_SONGS_DIR_PATH3`, ... to use multiple dirs
- `PLAYLIST_CACHE_DIR_PATH` the path for caching playlists (only required when using spotify features)
	- gets automatically created (recursively)
- `IS_DEFAULT_PAGE_THEME_MODE_DARK` `true` or `false`, the page has a dark mode, if `true`, the dark mode is initially used (on first load)


you have to copy the `secrets/.env_example` to `secrets/.env` and set all values

for the spotify stuff you need a account and a spotify app, see https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/tutorials/getting-started

## Code

Almost every line was generated with cursor (and GPT-5.2 Codex)


## Notes

The songtext search does not always work because we only have the syllables...
We concatenate all syllables to get words again but this also gives some false positives

Also the table views try to display the hit in context in the preview column if possible (a real word in the syllables matched)

## Ag grid

- we use ag grid for virtualized scrolling without it the search is really slow...
